    <h1>Biryani</h1>
    <img src="/img/chicken-biryani.jpeg" alt="Biryani">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish which is often reserved for very special occasions such as
        weddings, parties,
        or holidays such as Ramadan.
        <br>It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. For biryani, always use long grain rice.
        Basmati rice with its thin, fine grains is the ideal variety to use.
        <br>Ghee is butter that has been slowly melted so that the milk solids and golden liquid have been separated
        and can be used in place of vegetable oil to yield a more authentic taste.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Step</h4>
        </li>
        <p>In a large skillet, in 2 tablespoons vegetable oil (or ghee) fry potatoes until brown, drain and reserve the
            potatoes.
            <br> Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the skillet and fry onion, garlic and ginger until onion is soft and
            golden.
            <br> Add chili, pepper, turmeric, cumin, salt and the tomatoes. Fry, stirring constantly for 5 minutes.
            <br> Add yogurt, mint, cardamom and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally
            until the tomatoes are cooked to a pulp.
            <br> It may be necessary to add a little hot water if the mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the
            pan.
        </p>
        <li>
            <h4>Step</h4>
        </li>
        <p>When the mixture is thick and smooth, add the chicken pieces and stir well to coat them with the spice
            mixture.
            <br> Cover and cook over very low heat until the chicken is tender, approximately 35 to 45 minutes.
            <br> There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking.
            <br> If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.
        </p>
        <li>
            <h4>Step</h4>
        </li>
        <p>Wash rice well and drain in colander for at least 30 minutes.</p>
        <li>
            <h4>Step</h4>
        </li>
        <p>In a large skillet, heat vegetable oil (or ghee) and fry the onions until they are golden.
            <br> Add saffron, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon stick, ginger and rice.
            <br> Stir continuously until the rice is coated with the spices.
        </p>
        <li>
            <h4>Step</h4>
        </li>
        <p>In a medium-size pot, heat the chicken stock and salt. When the mixture is hot pour it over the rice and stir
            well.
            <br> Add the chicken mixture and the potatoes; gently mix them into the rice. Bring to boil.
            <br> Cover the saucepan tightly, turn heat to very low and steam for 20 minutes.
            <br> Do not lift lid or stir while cooking. Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.
